Wallet OTP provides self-custody of your MFA secrets through public-key encryption so that **you and only you** can generate dynamic OTP (one time password) tokens that let you log in to any web2 or web3 service with your wallet

Sign in with your wallet to encrypt and store your MFA secrets for any web2 or web3 account (Instagram, Gmail, Tiktok, Kraken, Coinbase, etc). Then when you need to authenticate with your second auth factor, use the Wallet OTP app to get a dynamic OTP based on your secret.

The Wallet OTP app is a work in progress: https://wallet-otp.on.fleek.co/ - the hackathon ends June 21, 2023

## But I already use Twilio's Authy app for this... why should I use Wallet OTP instead?

1. Data ownership
2. Wallet convenience (not device specific)
3. Vibes 🪩💖

btw, this is Authy in case you're not familiar with it:

### 1. Data ownership

- We've all heard, "Not your keys, not your crypto!"
- Introducing.... 🥁🥁🥁 **"Not your MFA secrets, not your social accounts"**

Wallet OTP is a wallet custody solution for MFA secret storage so you no longer have to trust centralized OTP token generators like Authy with storage of your MFA secrets for services like Snapchat, Twitch, and Google.

Wallet OTP uses your wallet to encrypt and store your MFA secrets, then generates OTP tokens for you any time you need them for login. 


### 2. Convenience because wallets are device agnostic

One time I got a new phone and lost access to all my social accounts because my MFA access was tied to an authenticator that used local storage on my old phone that I'd already wiped. 😭😭😭😭😭

I touched so much grass that day! 🥲

Anyway, with Wallet OTP even if you get a new phone or laptop, you keep MFA access to all your accounts because OTP generation is tied to your wallet, not a specific device.


### 3. Vibes
